This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in a COBOL program that can arise due to implicit assumptions about variable updates within multiple execution paths and the use of 'GO TO' statements. The bug is explained in detail in the bug.cob and bugSolution.cob files. The solution involves restructuring the code to remove the 'GO TO' statements and to explicitly handle all possible execution paths, improving readability and maintainability.
