This code has a potential bug because of the implicit assumption that the program will automatically update WS-AREA-1 only once in a given execution path. If there were multiple execution paths leading to PARA-1, the condition IF WS-AREA-1 > 5 may not work as intended. Also, the 'GO TO' statements make the program structure complex and prone to logical errors. It is generally recommended to avoid 'GO TO' statements in modern COBOL programs because they makes the program flow harder to understand and maintain.
